/**
 * Represents a direction of movement in a two-dimensional grid.
 *
 * @property dRow The change in row associated with this direction.
 * @property dCol The change in column associated with this direction.
 *
 * This class provides utilities for working with two-dimensional directional vectors,
 * which might be used for navigation, grid-based simulations, or pathfinding algorithms.
 * It implements the `AStep` interface, allowing this direction to also be treated as a step.
 *
 * Directions are defined as `(dRow: dCol)` pairs, where `dRow` indicates the vertical movement
 * and `dCol` indicates the horizontal movement. Certain static properties in the companion
 * object define common directions such as `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, and `Right`, as well as their
 * combinations like `UpLeft` or `DownRight`.
 *
 * Key functional utilities in this class include:
 * - `clockWise`: Rotates the direction clockwise by 90 degrees.
 * - `counterClockwise`: Rotates the direction counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
 * - `invert`: Inverts the direction to point in the opposite direction.
 * - `split`: Splits diagonal directions into their cardinal components.
 *
 * The class also includes boolean properties (`isHorizontal`, `isVertical`) to help determine
 * whether the direction corresponds to purely horizontal or vertical movement, and methods
 * like `isOpposite` to check relationships between directions.
 *
 * The `toString` method provides a formatted string representation of the direction in the form
 * `(dRow:dCol)` for easy debugging and display.
