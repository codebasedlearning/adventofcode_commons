/**
 * Represents an undirected weighted graph structure, where nodes are generic elements of type `T`
 * and edges between nodes can have weights.
 *
 * @param T The type of elements contained in the graph.
 *
 * This graph supports the following operations:
 * - Adding nodes and weighted edges to the graph.
 * - Removing nodes and edges from the graph.
 * - Checking for the presence of nodes.
 * - Retrieving the neighbors and weights of edges for a given node.
